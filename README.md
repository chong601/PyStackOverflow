Support for < 2016 will be implemented if there's a sane way to extract the schema data.

Not to mention that early StackOverflow data is pretty spotty.

# Why?
Because why not? Also, data is data, someone somewhere in the world will make one if they feel like they want to!

PyStackOverflow aims to provide quick and easy way to load and expose the insights data using whatever database you want!
